Different classes of missions have different reliability strategies. For critical missions (e.g., **human-rated**), reliability is paramount, requiring **higher quality parts** and **full [[Redundancy Strategies|redundancy strategies]]** for all critical systems.

## Mission Classifications

The table below shows the classes of reliability[^1]:

| Class           | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Experimental    | Generally short mission to demonstrate capability or gather data to answer a specific question. Missions in this class are often secondary payloads on a launch vehicle. |
| Operational     | Mission to gather critical data or to provide critical services.                             |
| Human-Rated     | Vehicles that must support humans.                                                           |

## Mission Lifetime and Redundancy Considerations

Refer to [[Redundancy Strategies]] for detailed redundancy strategies based on mission lifetime.

### Key Considerations
- Redundancy doesn't protect against design flaws
- Before adding redundant components, consider:
  - Extra testing
  - Better parts
  - More thorough analysis of single-string design
- Watch for reliability of switching mechanisms between redundant components
- System reliability includes deployment time considerations
- Balance needed between:
  - Costs/delays for ensuring reliability
  - Costs/delays from post-launch failures
