# Propulsion

# Basics

Idea: Acceleration ($\Delta v$) by ejection of material

Need:

- Energy: needed to throw out propellant/mass to get push, some converted to $E_{kin}$
- Propellant

Statements about $\Delta v$:

- $\Delta v$ does *not only* result from space propulsion but change in mass 
â†’ also $F_g$, Drag etc.
- $\Delta v$ is not only velocity change but also orbit change 
â†’ change in velocity linked to Energy change: $E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 -m\frac{\mu}{r}$
- $\Delta v \ne$ velocity change 
â†’ velocity and $\Delta v$ depend on orbit, if $\Delta v$ in direction of acceleration altitude $\uparrow$ & velocity $\downarrow$ BUT Energy will increase
- $\Delta v$ same for $\pm$ a 
â†’ same effort for acceleration and deceleration!

## Tsiolkovsky rocket equation:

$$
\Delta v = v_e \ln(\frac{m_0}{m_1})= v_e \ln(\frac{m_w}{m_d}) = v_e\ln(\frac{m_d +m_p}{m_d}) = v_e \ln(1 + \frac{m_p}{m_d})\\ \Leftrightarrow m_p =m_d \cdot (e^{\frac{\Delta v}{v_e}} -1)
$$

$$
MR = \frac{m_w}{m_d} = \frac{m_d + m_p}{m_d} \Rightarrow \Delta v = v_e \ln(MR)
$$

$\Delta v$: Maximal change of velocity of vehicle [m/s]

$v_e$: Exhaust velocity [m/s] 

*â†’ describes magnitude for performance of propulsion system in relation with complexity, risk, costsâ€¦*

$m_1$: Mass at $t_1$ [kg] â†’ $m_1 = m_0-\Delta m$

$m_2$: Mass at $t_2$ [kg]

$\Delta m$: ejected mass [kg]

$m_w$: wet mass, initial total mass including propellant [kg] â†’ $m_w = m_d + m_p$

$m_d$: dry mass, final total mass without propellant [kg]

$m_p$: Propellant mass [kg]

MR: mass ratio between initial mass and final mass

## Specific impulse

Def: a measure of how efficiently an engine generates thrust. It is defined as the total impulse normalized by the weight of the propellant. The specific impulse can also be defined as the ratio of thrust to the propellant weight flow rate. â†’ NOT used to compare different propellants

$$
I_{sp} = \frac{v_e}{g_0}= \frac{F}{\dot{m}g_0}
$$

$I_{sp}$: Specific impulse [s] â†’ does not account for mass which is not fuel

$F$: thrust magnitude [N]

$\dot{m}$: Mass flow rate of propellant [kg/s]

$g_0$: earth gravitational acceleration [m/s^2] = 9.8065 m/s^2

â†’ for same $\Delta v$ needed the MR is smaller for higher $v_e$ = higher efficiency

![image.png](/Course%20Summary/_resources/Propulsion-image1.png)

â†’ the higher $v_e$ the higher MR! â‡’ need staging!

![image.png](/Course%20Summary/_resources/Propulsion-image2.png)

### Mission feasibility limit

Specific impulse must be above certain value for a system to work!

$$
I_{sp} \geq \frac{\Delta v}{\ln(\frac{1}{f_{inert}})g_0}
$$

$f_{inert}$: given by propulsion technology used

$\Delta v$: Mission requirement

## Staging

Idea: reducing mass of rocket by jettisoning stages when they run out of propellant

â†’ Performance increase as mass is gradually reduced

Advantage: each stage can be optimized for its specific operating conditions

### Optimizing Launcher staging

Initial to final mass ratio:

â†’ can be established for single stage launchers as well as multiple stage launchers

$$
\eta = \frac{m_d+m_p+m_{PL}}{m_d+m_{PL}} = \frac{1+\lambda}{\epsilon + \lambda}
$$

Structural ratio: 
â†’ ratio between empty masses of stage & combined empty mass and propellant mass

$$
\epsilon = \frac{m_d}{m_d +m_p}
$$

Payload ratio:

â†’ ratio between $m_{PL}$ & combined masses of empty rocket stage and propellant mass

$$
\lambda = \frac{m_{PL}}{m_d+m_p}
$$
