# 0. Introduction

Why PM? 

- master complexity
- enhance transparency
- manage risks

## The magic triangle

![image.png](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image.png)

*Scope: quality, functionality, convenience, service etc.*

Extended triangle: Quality and Risks 

## The Process

- Initialization
    - Decision to implement the project
    - Define boundary conditions/scope
    - Which PM approach shall be used?
- Definition
    - Goals & Requirements
    - Project organization, interfaces & core team
- Planning
    - Tasks, schedules, resources & costs
- Execution
    - Realization of project content
    - Monitoring of Project status
    - Measures to adhere to plan/Plan Changes
- Closing
    - Formal conclusion of project with client
    - Discuss & Secure project findings to improve future projects
    - Dissolving of project organization

![Changes over project phase in impact of decisions, risk, costs and knowledge](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image1.png)

Changes over project phase in impact of decisions, risk, costs and knowledge

## The Methods

### Planbased (classic)

**Definition**: 
Activities structured into phases & work packages. Sequential processing of project phases.

Note: *Less used as not one single person can know the whole product 
→ distribution of responsibility*

![image.png](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image2.png)

- Example: Waterfall
    
    Beginning of new phase *only* after previous phase fully completed
    
    Phase-rollback if phase NOT sucessfully completed
    
    ![image.png](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image3.png)
    

### Agile

**Definition**: 
Self-organizing team, continuous review and adaptation of team. Focused on: **fast**, **iterative** delivery of results & prototypes

![image.png](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image4.png)

- Example: SCRUM
    
    Method: 
    
    1. Product Backlog: prioritized organization of Project tasks
    2. Sprints: Iterations during project execution at pre-planned intervals
    3. Product Increment: Product achievement → is improved in retrospective
    4. Sprint review: regular review of product increment
    
    Roles:
    
    - Product Owner: interface to costumer
    - Team:  **acts autonomously** & are **self-organized**
    - Scrum Master: moderator of process
    
    Overview:
    
    ![image.png](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image5.png)
    

### Hybrid approach

$\to$ Combination of elements form plan-based & agile method

---

# 1. Project Planning and Implementation

## 1.1 Mission, Vision, Goals

1. Mission - Why?
    
    → Core purpose of project
    
2. Vision - Where do we want to be?
    
    → Long-term outcome
    
3. Goals - What is to be achieved?
    
    → broad targets necessary to fulfill mission & vision
    
4. Objectives - How is it achieved?
    
    → SMART: Specific, Measurable, Ambitious ,Realistic, Time-bound 
    
    ⇒ Narrower, more focused than goals
    
5. Requirements - What criteria must be met?
    
    → precise technical specification necessary to meet objects&goals
    

![image.png](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image6.png)

## 1.2 Project Phases & Milestones

| Milestones | Phases (According to ESA) |
| --- | --- |
| • MDR: Mission Definition Review
• PRR: Preliminary Requirements review
• SRR: System Requirements review
• PDR: Preliminary Design Review
• CDR: Critical Design Review
• QR: Qualification review
• AR: Acceptance review
• ORR: Operational readiness review
• FRR: Flight Readiness Review
• LRR: Launch Readiness Review
• CRR: Comissioning Result Review
• ELR: End-of-life Review
• MCR: Mission Closeout Review | • Phase 0: Mission analysis/needs identification
• Phase A: Feasibility
• Phase B: Preliminary Definition
• Phase C: Detailed Definition
• Phase D: Qualification and Production
• Phase E: Utilization
• Phase F: Disposal |

## 1.3 Project Organization

Phase plan $\to$ Organization Breakdown structure

Product tree $\to$ Work breakdown structure $\to$ Work packages

Organization Breakdown structure:

→ Who does what and how do people relate to each other?

![Contact officer: Change negotiations, System Engineer: make sure all fits together, Product assurance: quality management, Project Manager: Make team perform](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image7.png)

Contact officer: Change negotiations, System Engineer: make sure all fits together, Product assurance: quality management, Project Manager: Make team perform

Work breakdown structure (WBS):

- Subprojects for general structurung
- Subtasks per Subproject
- Workpackages in Subtask or Subproject incl. Workpackage Nr containing code of WBS 
→ smallest unit of WBS

Principle: From Broad to detail

Work Packages:

→ What needs to be done?

| Characteristics | Typical Content |
| --- | --- |
| • Clearly defined & separated from other packages
• Self-contained
• Basis for planning
• Assigned to responsible Person | • Title & Number
• Person responsible
• Star & End date
• Inputs & prerequisites
• Description of Task
• Deliverables |

# 2. Cost & Schedule Management

## 2.1  Cost Estimation and Planning

### Cost Categories

- Labour Costs
- Infrastructure & Facility Costs
- Other Costs
    - Materials
    - Procurements
    - Various

### Cost estimation Methods

Top down vs. Bottom up

- Bottom-up Estimate (Grass-root estimate)
- Multiplier Method
- PERT

|  | Top Down | Bottom Up |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Description | • Quick
• Simple
• Ballpark figure | • Higher Effort
• Project Specific
• More precise |
| Methods | • heuristic Method
• Parametric estimate
• Percentage Method | • Bottom-up Estimate/Grass-root estimate
• Multiplier Method
• PERT: Program Evaluation & review technique |

Other Methods:

- Comparative Estimate/Analogy
- Expert Judgement → Delphi

### Impact of Estimation Errors

- Overestimation: estimated effort > actual effort
    - Student Syndrome: Work is done as late as possible → inefficient/delays
    - Parkinson’s Law: Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion
- Underestimation: estimated effort < actual effort
    - Additional efforts required to manage discrepancy btw. estimated & actual effort

![Total effort of project depends on whether the actual effort is under- or overestimated.](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image8.png)

Total effort of project depends on whether the actual effort is under- or overestimated.

How to properly handle the situation?

→ **Margin-Management**: actively estimated based on project situation, know-how and Environment

![image.png](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image9.png)

## 2.2 Project Schedule

Gantt-Chart: → visualizes throughput time

- Float: Margin on activity till it will delay the other work package/project
- Critical Path: any delay in work package will extend project duration

Important: Effort ≠ throughput time

## 2.3 Resource Planning

Shows the effort one has to put in.

→ Visualizes if people are “überlastet”

Important: People cannot be switched on/off → time to get to know the project/problem

Iterations necessary (even during project)

- project always have change of plans
- resources are limited

## 2.4 Project Budgeting

Cost plan →  cost curve

⇒ cost curve is never directly linear

![image.png](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image10.png)

---

# 3. Project Control

Deming Cycle:

![image.png](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image11.png)

Adaptations:

- Adjust resources
→ hire more people: limited because more people = longer information transfer
- reduce efforts
- Increase productivity
→ Trainings, focus, invest in more expensive tools
- Improve process quality
→ Important in limited time scopes (like now 😅)
- Modify/change scope

Hint:

- Scope has to be adapted with costumer
- Effort: intern → lower precision = lower effort but SAME Scope

## 3.1 Cost control

Importance of Schedule: Large projects are controlled by schedule → time = $

Key performance indicators: → always compare planned & actual

- Duration
- Costs
- Progress percentage (%)

If deviation between planned & actual, determine:

- Time-to complete
- Cost-to-Complete

![image.png](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image12.png)

- Example Method: Earned Value Analysis (EVA)
    
     → Combines magic triangle: Scope, Cost & Time
    
    ![Only Aspects that have been fully completed & reviewed contribute to EV](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image13.png)
    
    Only Aspects that have been fully completed & reviewed contribute to EV
    

## 3.2 Schedule Control

**Milestone trend Analysis**

Concept: 
→ Horizontal line reaches pink diagonal line work package/project needs to be done

horizontal line: if everything works as planed

vertical line: changes in plans, delay

![image.png](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image14.png)

## 3.3 Change and Claim Management

Def: Claim = not instructed change of scope

**Change management**

![Schematic Change Management Process](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image15.png)

Schematic Change Management Process

**Claim Management**

1. **Initialization** → *Prevention*
    1. Scope of delivery & services
    2. Contractual agreement on claim process
2. **Definition** → *Preparation*
    1. In contract consider negotiation results on: scope, cost, schedule 
    2. Implement procedural guidelines withing project
3. **Planning** → *Implementation*
    1. Identify potential claim events
    2. Documentation
    3. Objective and commercial review
    4. clarify facts
    5. settle claim-related demands
4. **Execution**  → *Implementation* (see step 4)
5. **Closing** → *Knowledge Management*
    1. Checklists
    2. Strategy - Procedural guidelines

---

# 4. Procurement Management

## Plan-based

1. Clarify procurement requirements
2. Create procurement plan
3. Prepare tender documents
→Draft of contract, requirements & scope = Proposal
4. Conduct Tender evaluation
→ Tender evaluation board, confidential
5. Negotiate Contract & complete procurement
→ clarify scope!

Procurement Methods:

- Request for Information (RFI)
    - Obtaining non-binding price and performance information. Suitable for market assessment.
    - first bidding, only ROM cost (rough order of magnitude) & technical evaluation
    - Early stage, lot of design freedom
- Request for Quotation (RFQ)
    - Request for non-binding prices for a defined procurement item
    - No defining price, sometimes also bidding offer
    - More detailed than RFI
- Request for Proposal (RFP)
    - Tendering in true sense. Invitation to submit a binding offer
    - Clear poproposal to company
- Invitaiton to Tender (ITT)
    - Used in public tendering → invitation to all

Tender Process types (who can apply): → type based on amount of money

- Restricted competition
→ defined number of companies are invited to submit RFI, RFQ, RFP
→ pre-selection is already done in advance by person who chooses
- Open competition
→ Tender documents are publicly published on tandering platform.
→ all interested & qualified can submit a bit
- Selective Tender
    1.  Pre-qualification documents published publicly.
    2. All interest & suitable companies register to participate
    3. min 3 pre-qualified companies taken into procedure → closed to public
    
    → highly complex procurement 
    
- Direct Negotiations:
→ low costs. Public authority directly awards contracts. Must be justified

## Agile

1. Clarify procurement requirements
2. Select suitable suppliers
3. Implement pilot project
→several companies in parallel (2-3), ask team what added value is
4. Negotiate contract and finalize procurement

Best practice:

- Focus on acquiring the most suitable resources 
→ conduct small pilot project with several providers
- Ideally a product concept & initial product backlog is developed before starting procurement process
- Do not outsource role of product owner → ensure necessary expertise is maintained

# 5. Risk Management

Risk evaluation depends on environment/culture!

## 5.1 Risk management Process

Risk potential = Probabilty of occurence * Damage potential

| Risk type | What does it contain |
| --- | --- |
| Rechnical Risk | New procuct, material properties, complexity, approach.. |
| Schedule Risk | Availability of inputs, facilities, resources |
| Commercial  | Cost cap, creditworthiness of business partners… |
| Resource  | Availability, adequacy, … |
| Market  | Competitor product is better/cheaper |
| Legal  | Product liability, contracts, … |
| Political | Changes in corporate strategy, legislation |

**The Process:**

1. Identify
    1. all possible fields of risk
    2. collect all risk-relevant information (maybe prepared list of risks)
2. Analyze
    1. Asses & weigh identified risks
    2. evaluate the probability of occurrence and the extent
3. Manage/Do sth about it
    1. Develop measures and prepare strategies
        1. Avoidance
        2. Reduction
        3. Transfer
        4. Acceptance
4. Monitor
    1. Regular checks and status announcements
    2. ensure that new risks are identifies

## 5.2 Risk Management in Space Projects

Risk index 

do risk assessment before beginning of project

Goal: Mitigate risk \to severity $\downarrow$

![image.png](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image19.png)

- **Quality assurance**
    
    Objective: 
    Ensure consistent adherence to methods and processes during the project life cycle in order to produce a high-quality product
    
    ![image.png](/Course%20Summary/_resources/ProjectManagement-image20.png)
    

## 6.2 Quality Management Tools

The seven tools of quality (Q7)

1. Checklist or Tally sheet
2. (Quality) Control Chart
3. Correlation- or scatter plot
4. Fishbone-Diagram
    1. Goal: visualize & analyze causes and effect for problem diagnosis
    → See exercise Apollo 13 root cause analysis
5. Flowchart
6. Pareto-Diagram
7. Histogram

**Potential problem Areas**

| Potential problem Areas | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Personnel | - project team members
- Project organization
- Future user groups and stakeholders |
| Machine | - Tolls and infrastructure of project |
| Environment | - context of project (parent organization/cultural differences in international projects)
- … |
| Material | - resources needed to execute project
- incl $$ |
| Method | - type of project management
- specific methods and techniques at technical level |
| Measurement | - heavily dependent on method used
- key performance indicators and measurement criteria
- acquisition of data and facts |
