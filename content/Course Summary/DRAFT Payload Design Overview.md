**Remote Sensing:**

- Main Service: Environmental monitoring, space exploration, astronomy, climate studies
- Examples: Hubble, LandSat
- Characteristics: passive (optical telescope) or active (radar)
- How: Analysis of EM-spectrum, Interaction of light with object: → Reflection, absorption, transmission

- Characteristics: Antenna, transponders, amplifiers for signal processors
- Design Considerations: Frequency band, Beam Steering(Power), Redundancy
- Challenges:
    - Thermal managment (high power needs robust cooling)
    - Mass & power limitations

**In-Situ Payloads:**

- Main Service: collection of data/material, conduction of experiments on-sight
- Examples: Instruments on mars rovers( Perseverance), landers (inSight) and orbiters
- Characteristics: equipped with sensors, drills, analyzers
- Design Considerations:
    - Robustness to survive in harsh conditions
    - Miniaturization to fit within spacecraft
    - Redundancy and reliability → no repair possibility
- Challenges:
    - Dust, radiation, mechanical wear → degrade of instrument performance
    - complex mechanisms: operate autonomously at high precision

**Active vs passive** (CHAT GPT GENERATED)

|  | Active | Passive |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Definition | Systems emit their own energy (e.g., radar, LiDAR) and measure the response after it interacts with the target. | Systems rely on naturally available energy sources, such as sunlight or thermal emissions. |
| Application | • Radar: Mapping terrain, monitoring weather, detecting subsurface structures.
• LiDAR: High-resolution topography, vegetation analysis, and planetary mapping | • Optical Imaging: Capturing reflected sunlight for Earth observation or astronomical imaging.
• Thermal Infrared: Monitoring heat emissions for climate studies and detecting heat leaks in spacecraft. |
| Advantages | • Works under all lighting conditions (day or night).
• Penetrates clouds and can assess subsurface layers (e.g., ground-penetrating radar). | • Lower power consumption since no energy is emitted.
• Simpler system design compared to active sensors |
| Challenges | • Requires high power for signal generation.
• More complex systems increase cost and risk of failure. | •  Requires sufficient natural light or heat, limiting nighttime or low-signal environments.
• Susceptible to interference from atmospheric conditions or environmental noise. |

### Defining Payloads - from Mission requirement to payload design

Important: Iterative process!

→ after first design analyze impact on space craft design → new trades, search for optimal solution

Process of Payload design/requirements derival

![Tab. 15-1: The process moves from mission requirements to payload design in three steps: requirement analysis, subject trade, payload analysis](/Course%20Summary/_resources/DRAFTPayloadDesignOverview-image1.png)

Tab. 15-1: The process moves from mission requirements to payload design in three steps: requirement analysis, subject trade, payload analysis

1. Define Mission Objective:

- For base for Payload definition, what shall the mission acheive
1. Define Requirements
- detailed requirements to achieve mission objectives
- definition of measurable physical values, resolution, precision & period of data acquisition
- Types:
    - Baseline: desired, performance goal
    - Threshold: acceptable
    
    → leads to trade-offs
    
1. Subject trades
- what does the payload measure/with what shall it interact?
- Selection of PL will influence power, cost, mission concept → difference in active and passive!

Tab 15-4

Process Defining Space Payloads(SMAD):

| Process Step | Product |
| --- | --- |
| 1 - Use mission objectives, concept, requirements and constraints to select payload objectives | PL performance objectives |
| 2 - Conduct subject trades | Subject definition&performance thresholds |
| 3 - Develop payload ConOps | End-to-end concept for all mission phases operating modes |
| 4 - Determine required payload capabilities to meet mission objectives | Required payload capability |
| 5 - Identify candidate payloads | Initial list of potential payloads |
| 6 - Estimate candidate payload capabilities & characteristics | Assessment of each candidate payload |
| 7 - Evaluate candidate payloads and select a baseline | Preliminary PL definition |
| 8 - Assess lifecycle costs & operability of payload and mission | Revised PL performance requirements constrained by costs/architecture limitation |
| 9 - Identify & negotiate payload-derived requirements | Derived requirements for related subsystems |
| 10 - Document and iterate | Baseline Payload Design |

Implications on spacecraft architecture& mission execution

- Architecture:
    - Power, mass, size, communication, thermal control, pointing restrictions
- Mission execution:
    - Influences how mission will be conducted, which product/data the end-user will receive

### Design Evaluation

→ A complex process!

Payload design considerations:

- Performance
Assessment based on various criterias: spectral, radiometric or temporal resolution
Definition of absolute minimum threshold(mission would just work out) & baseline(ideal mission)
→ Mission success is dependent on payload performance ⇒ design is critical
→ All Payloads have physical and operational performance constraints!
- Cost
Key factor, costs over whole life cycle
Goal: Max performance per cost unit
Minimum amount of $ necessary to be able to achieve performance at all
→ after this point additional expenses increase performance significantly (but costs $\uparrow$)
- Mission constraints
Factors: Size, Mass, Power, Datarate, Lifeduration
Operational constraints: Planning&Coordination of payload task executions → limited sensor duty cycles, tasking & scheduling limits on sensor time + resource contention: inability of sensor to view two targets of interest at same time.

### Application Across Payload types

Apply to real-world examples

- Mars-Rover:
    - In-Situ Payloads: many instruments for surface analysis, local environment studies, sample collection
    - Cameras: Navigation, parnorama, scientific analysis
    - Spectrometers: XRF, LIBS, Raman Spectroscopy → analyze composition of materials
    - Geophysical palyoads: Magnetometer, Seisomometer, ground penetrating Radar

Remote Sensing:

- LandSat
    - Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors such as the **Operational Land Imager (OLI)** and **Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS)** onboard Landsat 8 and 9.
    - Goal: Agriculture monitoring, forest management, disaster response, urban planning, and climate change analysis.
    - Passive sensors
    - Design considerations:  The **Operational Land Imager (OLI)** provides high spatial and spectral resolution (15–30 m resolution across various bands), balancing precision with manageable data volumes. This design enables global coverage and periodic revisits without exceeding spacecraft power or data transmission limits.
    - Spacecraft architecture implications:
    The thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat necessitates specialized thermal management and integration with efficient solar-powered systems to handle the energy requirements of the sensors.

Communication:

- GPS
    - Payloads:  Atomic clocks to maintain precise timing, Signal transmitters for broadcasting navigation data.
    - Goal:  The primary objective of GPS is precise positioning and timing, achieved through atomic clocks and signal payloads. The payload directly determines the system’s ability to provide sub-meter accuracy and synchronization of time-critical operations globally.
    - Active vs Passive: GPS satellites employ a hybrid of active and passive principles:
        - The satellites **actively broadcast signals** (active communication).
        - Receivers passively receive these signals and calculate positions without emitting energy.
    - Design Considerations:
        - **Frequency Bands**: Multiple frequencies (L1, L2, L5) reduce errors caused by ionospheric delays.
        - **Redundancy**: Backup systems ensure continuous operation, even in case of failures.
        - **Power Management**: The payload transmits signals with sufficient power to reach Earth but must also be efficient to conserve satellite energy.
    - Spacecraft architecture implications:
        - Atomic clocks and transmitters demand robust thermal management to maintain clock accuracy.
        - Solar panels are optimized to supply power for continuous signal transmission.
        - Antennas are designed to provide global coverage with minimal signal loss.
