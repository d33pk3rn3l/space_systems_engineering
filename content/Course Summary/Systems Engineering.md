### Mission architecture vs mission concept

Mission architecture (WHAT) identifies the building blocks of the mission , while the mission concept (HOW) describes how these building blocks work together to achieve the mission's objectives.

- Example:  Water rescue
    
    **Mission architecture** includes all the equipment and personnel needed to carry out the rescue (boat, truck, radios, etc.). **Mission concept** refers to how these resources are utilized to conduct the rescue (e.g., driving the truck as close as possible to the people in need, launching the boat, and staying in contact via radio). **Mission operations** would then be the detailed process of maneuvering the boat through the whitewater, reaching the people in need, and rescuing them.
    

Short overview:

|  | Mission Architecture | Mission Concept |

### Alternative Architecture vs. Alternative Mission Concept

**Relationship:**

- **Not Always a New Architecture**: An alternative mission concept does not necessarily require a completely new architecture. An alternative concept can also be based on the same architecture but operate in a different way.
    - For example, an existing satellite architecture could be used with a new concept that processes data onboard the satellite instead of on Earth.
- **Architecture Influences Concept**: The chosen architecture affects how the mission concept can be designed, as certain architectural elements suggest specific operational methods and approaches.
- **Concept Can Influence Architecture**: Conversely, a new mission concept can reveal the need for a new architecture. For instance, the idea of direct communication with end-users via simple devices like mobile phones might require a different satellite architecture than one that relies on large ground stations.

| **Aspect** | **Alternative Architecture** | **Alternative Mission Concept** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | Selection and combination of the fundamental mission elements (building blocks of the mission). | Description of how these elements work together to achieve mission objectives (workflow of the mission). |
| **Focus** | What is used for the mission? (e.g., sensors, spacecraft, orbit). | How does the mission work? (e.g., data transmission, task allocation, communication). |
| **Elements** | Payload, spacecraft bus, launch system, orbit, communication structure, ground system, end-user. | Data transmission, task allocation and control, communication architecture, mission timeline. |
| **Change** | At least one of the fundamental elements is chosen differently than in the original architecture. | Can explore new ways of executing the mission within an existing architecture or propose new architectural elements. |
| **Relationship** | The chosen architecture influences how the mission concept can be designed. A new mission concept can reveal the need for a new architecture. | The way components interact can reveal the need for a different combination of fundamental mission elements. The mission concept can utilize an existing architecture or propose new elements. |
| **Iterative Process** | The development of architecture and concept is often iterative. You can start with an existing architecture and explore various concepts, or begin with a concept and design multiple architectures to support it. | The development of architecture and concept is often iterative. You can start with an existing architecture and explore various concepts, or begin with a concept and design multiple architectures to support it. |
| **Examples (FireSat II)** | - Alternative Architecture: A smaller satellite in a lower Earth orbit with a different sensor instead of a larger satellite in geostationary orbit. | - Alternative Mission Concept: Automating fire detection onboard the spacecraft instead of manual analysis on the ground. |
| **Examples (SCS)** | - Alternative Architecture: Minimize user devices and shift more data processing power onboard the spacecraft. | - Alternative Mission Concept: Direct communication with users via simple devices, like mobile phones, instead of relying on complex ground stations. |

### Requirements:

**Requirements before analysis, requirements before design!**

**Requirements must be changed to always be up to date!**

System requirements fall in **three main areas**

- Functional (E.g., what should it do?)
- Operational (E.g., how do I run it, get the data down?)
- Constraints (E.g., how much can it cost?)

**Requirement Evolution**

- **Phase A: Define** the mission requirements
- **Phase B: Identify** critical driving requirements and risks
- **Phase C: Detail**: Specify system and segment definition and add interface requirements
- **Phase D:** Flow down, **formal design documentation**

### **Iterative Design Process:**

- **Iteration and Refinement**: **Iteration** remains a **critical part of mission design**, focusing on refining system trades and performance assessments. Methods like Monte Carlo simulations are instrumental in evaluating possible scenarios, identifying unusual parameter combinations, and preparing robust system solutions.
- **Mission Requirements Evolution**: **Requirements are dynamic** and must adjust to project constraints and system design realities. The need to **revise and optimise requirements** based on trade-offs between cost, risk, and performance is emphasised.
- **Flow-Down Process**: The **iterative allocation of requirements to subsystems** is critical for ensuring mission alignment while maintaining cost-effectiveness.
- The process **involves evaluating alternative architectures** and conducting **trade studies** to balance cost, risk, and performance.

### Mission Analysis **and Mission Utility**:

The Mission Analysis help to figure out if the problem is feasible, whether weâ€™re on the right path and so on. Therefore different Analyses can be performed.

- **Feasibility Assessment:** To determine if **the problem is achievable**
- **Sizing estimates:** Estimate the fundamental parameters such as **size, weight, power and cost**
- **Point Design:** Design a b**aseline for the entire system** without any optimisation to **demonstrate the feasibility** of the mission and have a baseline for alternatives.
- **Utility Analysis**: Mission utility analysis ensures a **quantitative understanding of how design choices align with mission objectives.** This is achieved using **performance parameters** (how good the system works) and **measures of effectiveness (MoEs)**(how good the system meets the objectives).
- **Trade Studies**: Effective **trade studies analyse the impact of key parameters on cost, risk, and performance.** They involve critical evaluations of altitude, instrument resolution, and communication systems, balancing mission feasibility with performance goals.

Further the performance can be assessed through [system algorithms](Clarifications%20172607ce73f88072b162e776f199d1cf.md), analogy with existing systems or simulations.

### **Integration and Testing**:

- Emphasis on **ensuring subsystems work seamlessly** in the operational environment.
- Simulations replicate conditions like pressure, temperature, and composition, although **gravity-related effects require innovative workarounds** (e.g., pulley systems).
- **Simulations and Risk Management**: Simulations, such as Monte Carlo methods, **replicate operational environments** and assess failure probabilities, providing **key insights into system robustness** before launch.

### **Trends and Challenges in Space Systems**:

- **Lower Costs**: Advances in reusable rockets (e.g., SpaceXâ€™s Falcon 9) and mass production have made **access to space more affordable.**
- **Sustainability**: Managing space debris and minimising resource waste is increasingly vital.
- **Autonomy and AI**: Autonomous systems, like the SMART Nav system used in DART, are becoming critical for precision operations in space.
- **Commercialisation**: Private sector involvement, exemplified by lunar infrastructure contracts (e.g., Intuitive Machines), is reshaping the space industry.
- **Sustainability**: Incorporating sustainability, such as minimising resource use and mitigating orbital debris, has gained prominence.
- **Error Budgets:** Error budgeting for critical metrics like positioning accuracy and power allocation is becoming a cornerstone of system design.

### **System Drivers and Critical Requirements:**

- System drivers, such as payload weight, power consumption, and thermal management, heavily influence design decisions.
- **Common system drivers:**
    
    Size, Power Propellant, Data Rate, Pointing Altitude, Coverage
    
- Critical requirements include mission duration, reliability, and data transmission rates.

### **Science Traceability Matrix**

The Science Traceability Matrix (STM) links high-level mission objectives to measurable science goals, mission requirements, and subsystem capabilities. It provides a structured approach for ensuring alignment between science goals and technical implementation. Key components include:

- **Science Goals**: Broad objectives the mission seeks to achieve.
- **Measurement Requirements**: Specific data or observations needed to meet science goals.
- **Instrument Capabilities**: Technical specifications of instruments that fulfil the measurement requirements.

By maintaining this hierarchy, the STM ensures scientific objectives are met through well-defined engineering and operational plans.

### **Flow Down**

The flow-down process systematically translates high-level mission objectives into detailed requirements for subsystems and components. It ensures consistency and alignment across all mission levels. Key steps include:

- Defining **mission objectives** at a strategic level.
- Breaking these objectives into **payload and system-level requirements** (e.g., data collection accuracy, environmental tolerances).
- Further refining into **subsystem requirements**, such as power, thermal, and structural specifications.

This approach guarantees that each subsystem contributes directly to achieving the overall mission objectives while maintaining traceability and coherence throughout the design and development process.

## Clarifications

System Algorithms:

- Describe how good a subsystem or system works. This is often done for instruments. An Example is an algorithm to classify the relation of aperture size and resolution and the wavelength dependence of optical devices.
- The downside is that all real systems are imperfect which is not regarded in the formulas.

Costs often experience major growth between Phases C-D

- Certain Subsystems were forgotten
- Certain requirements over-constrain subsystems
- Requirements change late â†’ redesign and wasted efforts
