## **Lecture Overview**

1. [**Design Process & Iteration](https://d33pk3rn3l.github.io/sse_page/Topics/Spacecraft-Design-Overview/Design-Process--and--Iteration)** 
    - Mission objectives and payload requirements drive initial architecture.
    - Multiple trade-offs between mass, power, cost, schedule, and reliability.
    - Documentation and stakeholder communication are critical at every phase.
2. [**Design Drivers**](https://d33pk3rn3l.github.io/sse_page/Topics/Spacecraft-Design-Overview/Design-Drivers)
    - Mass: Heavily influences launch vehicle choice and cost.
    - Power: Solar arrays vs. RTGs and their ripple effects on thermal, mass, and cost.
    - Cost & Schedule: Dictate depth of testing,Â [technology readiness](https://d33pk3rn3l.github.io/sse_page/Concepts/Technology-Readiness-Level), and iterative loops.
    - Reliability & Lifetime: Influence redundancy, component quality, and testing rigor.

3. [**Spacecraft Subsystems**](https://d33pk3rn3l.github.io/sse_page/Topics/Spacecraft-Design-Overview/Spacecraft-Subsystems)
    - Each subsystem (e.g., propulsion, ADC, power, thermal, structures, TT&C, onboard processing) must integrate seamlessly to meet mission goals.
4. [**Configuration Alternatives**](https://d33pk3rn3l.github.io/sse_page/Topics/Spacecraft-Design-Overview/Configuration-Alternatives)
    - Different attitude control methods (spin-stabilized vs. three-axis).
    - Solar array setups (fixed, deployable, sun-tracking).
    - Antenna placements for TT&C.
5. [**Spacecraft Budgets**](https://d33pk3rn3l.github.io/sse_page/Topics/Spacecraft-Design-Overview/Spacecraft-Budgets)
    - Mass, propellant, power, pointing, and data budgets ensure the design remains feasible.
    - Each budget is tracked with built-in margins and contingencies to handle uncertainties.

# **Key Takeaways**

- **Spacecraft design is iterative**â€”new data and changing requirements continuously refine the spacecraftâ€™s architecture.
- **Trade-off analyses**Â are vital for reconciling competing constraints: mass â†” power â†” cost â†” reliability â†” schedule.
- **Subsystems**Â must be coordinated to avoid local optimizations that jeopardize overall mission success.
- **Budgets**Â (mass, power, data, propellant) are crucial and carry contingency to manage design risks.
