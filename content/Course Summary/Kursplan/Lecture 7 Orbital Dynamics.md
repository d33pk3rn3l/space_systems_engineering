**Content Summary:**

- Newton's laws of motion, gravitational fields, and two-body system dynamics
- Kepler's laws and orbital parameters: eccentricity, semi-major axis, orbital period, inclination
- Vis-viva equation for orbital velocity, escape velocity, and Lagrange points
- Orbit types: LEO, MEO, GEO, SSO, Molniya
- Orbital maneuvers: Hohmann and bi-elliptical transfers, plane changes, rendezvous
- Interplanetary trajectories, gravitational assists, and orbital insertion techniques

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Understand fundamental principles of orbital dynamics, including Newton's and Kepler's laws, to describe and predict orbital motion.
- Analyze various orbit types and their parameters, such as eccentricity, inclination, or orbital period, for mission planning.
- Apply concepts of orbital transfers and maneuvers for efficient mission design.
