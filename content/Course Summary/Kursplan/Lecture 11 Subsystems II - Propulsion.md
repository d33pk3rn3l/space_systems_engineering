Exercise: Propulsion lab (in class)
Lecturer: Markus JÃ¤ger
Reading Ass: 18, Space Propulsion Analysis and Design (Humble, Henry & Larson, Space Technology Series), Review Rocket and Spacecraft Propulsion (Turner, Martin J. L., Springer)
Summaries: Propulsion (../../Propulsion%2016f607ce73f880ba9a1bdeeadeee5def.md) (only first part well covered)

**Content Summary:**

- Overview of propulsion types including chemical (solid, hybrid, liquid), electric (ion, Hall effect), nuclear, and pneumatic (cold gas).
- Key propulsion characteristics: specific impulse, thrust-to-weight ratio, fuel efficiency, and propellant types (cryogenic, storable, green).
- Propulsion system design features: thrust vector control, orbital maneuvers, system integration, and end-of-life disposal strategies.
- Considerations for propulsion systems: thermal management, testing and validation, reliability, safety, environmental impact, cost-effectiveness, and future technologies.

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Understand the fundamental principles and types of spacecraft propulsion systems with main focus on chemical and electric propulsion but also pneumatic and thermal propulsion
- Learn about propulsion system design, including specific impulse, fuel efficiency, and propellant choices
- Gain insights into operational aspects of propulsion systems, like orbital maneuvers, station keeping, and deorbiting
- Analyze propulsion systems from perspectives of integration, testing, safety, environmental impact, and future technologies
- Gain basic understanding on propulsion equipment
