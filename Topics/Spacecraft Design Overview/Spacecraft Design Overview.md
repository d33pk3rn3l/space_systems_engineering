# Spacecraft Design Overview

This note provides a high-level summary of the **Spacecraft Design** lecture.

> [!info] Content
> - The **iterative design process** for spacecraft.
> - Major **design drivers** such as mass, power, cost, schedule, reliability, and lifetime.
> - A breakdown of **key subsystems** and their interdependencies.
> - **Configuration alternatives** in spacecraft design.
> - How **spacecraft budgets** are estimated and managed.

Below you will find links to sub-pages for each specific area:

## Lecture Overview

1. **[[Design Process & Iteration]]**  
   - Mission objectives and payload requirements drive initial architecture.
   - Multiple trade-offs between mass, power, cost, schedule, and reliability.
   - Documentation and stakeholder communication are critical at every phase.

2. **[[Design Drivers]]**  
   - Mass: Heavily influences launch vehicle choice and cost.
   - Power: Solar arrays vs. RTGs and their ripple effects on thermal, mass, and cost.
   - Cost & Schedule: Dictate depth of testing, [[Technology Readiness Level|technology readiness]], and iterative loops.
   - Reliability & Lifetime: Influence redundancy, component quality, and testing rigor.

3. **[[Spacecraft Subsystems]]**  
   - Each subsystem (e.g., propulsion, ADC, power, thermal, structures, TT&C, onboard processing) must integrate seamlessly to meet mission goals.

4. **[[Configuration Alternatives]]**  
   - Different attitude control methods (spin-stabilized vs. three-axis).
   - Solar array setups (fixed, deployable, sun-tracking).
   - Antenna placements for TT&C.

5. **[[Spacecraft Budgets]]**  
   - Mass, propellant, power, pointing, and data budgets ensure the design remains feasible.
   - Each budget is tracked with built-in margins and contingencies to handle uncertainties.

# Key Takeaways

- **Spacecraft design is iterative**—new data and changing requirements continuously refine the spacecraft’s architecture.
- **Trade-off analyses** are vital for reconciling competing constraints: mass ↔ power ↔ cost ↔ reliability ↔ schedule.
- **Subsystems** must be coordinated to avoid local optimizations that jeopardize overall mission success.
- **Budgets** (mass, power, data, propellant) are crucial and carry contingency to manage design risks.
